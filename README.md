AirPure Innovations – Data-Driven Market Fit & Strategic Launch for Air Purifiers


📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Air Quality Index (AQI), health, vehicle, and population data (2022–2025) to design a data-backed air purifier product portfolio and market launch strategy for India.

Instead of stopping at visualization, the analysis directly informs:

Product feature design

Pricing tiers

Target cities

Launch timing

Revenue models

The goal was to answer one core business question:

“What kind of air purifier should be built, for whom, where, and why — using data?”


🎯 Business Problem

Most air purifiers in India follow a one-size-fits-all design, focusing only on generic PM2.5 filtration.

However:

Pollution profiles vary regionally and seasonally

Certain pollutants (NH3, SO3) are strongly linked to pediatric respiratory distress

Demand spikes are event-driven (smog episodes, post-monsoon peaks)

Key risk: Building the wrong product for the wrong city at the wrong time.


 📂 Data Used

Primary Dataset

AQI data (2022–2025)

Secondary Datasets

Respiratory health impact data

Vehicle fuel mix data

Population & density data

All datasets were cleaned, standardized, and merged using Python.


🧠 Analysis Approach
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python)

Removed inconsistent AQI records

Standardized city/state mappings

Engineered features such as:

Seasonal AQI buckets

Severe-day percentage

City-level severity ranking

Vehicle fuel share vs AQI impact

2. Exploratory & Diagnostic Analysis

Long-term AQI trends (2015–2025)

Seasonal and monthly pollution patterns

City-level severity concentration

Health impact correlation with AQI spikes

Vehicle fuel composition vs pollution levels

Demand signals during pollution emergencies

3. Visualization & BI (Power BI)
Built an executive-ready dashboard with:

Dynamic filters (state, city, year)

Severity mapping & priority city identification

Health impact summaries

Policy impact comparison

Demand trigger visualization



📊 Key Insights

56.9% of days in North & East India fall under Poor–Severe AQI

Cities like Delhi, Patna, Hajipur, Kolkata show persistent high-severity exposure

Pediatric respiratory cases spike alongside AQI peaks

Petrol & diesel vehicles dominate (>94%), sustaining urban exposure

Consumer interest in purifiers rises sharply during pollution emergencies


🧩 Product Strategy Output

Based on the analysis, a 4-model product portfolio was designed:

Model	Price Range	Target Use Case
AirPure Essential	₹7k–9k	Entry-level pediatric safety
AirPure Family Care	₹10k–14k	Urban family & daily exposure
AirPure Pro Medical	₹25k–30k	Severe & industrial pollution zones
AirPure Mini	< ₹7.5k	Travel & commute protection

Each model’s filters, sensors, noise levels, and features are mapped directly to dominant pollutants and consumer behavior.
